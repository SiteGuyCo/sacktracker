# Sack Tracker

Sack Tracker is a demo web application that displays crawfish prices in a stock-style dashboard. Open `index.html` in your browser to try the demo locally. The page shows:

- Current average crawfish price with color-coded trend
- A 7-day price chart powered by Chart.js
- Vendor tiles that let you switch the chart to each vendor's history

All data is static for demonstration purposes.
